# Deployment and Environment Configuration

## Environment Variables
Required environment variables for the application:
```bash
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=

# External APIs
NEXT_PUBLIC_JSEARCH_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_JSEARCH_API_HOST=
NEXT_PUBLIC_TAVUS_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

## Deployment Platforms
- **Primary**: Google Cloud Run with Docker containers
- **Alternative**: Netlify for static deployment
- **Development**: Local development with Next.js dev server

## Docker Configuration
- Multi-stage build process for optimization
- Proper environment variable handling
- Nginx configuration for production serving
- Health checks and proper logging

## Build Process
- Next.js static generation for optimal performance
- Bundle optimization and code splitting
- Asset optimization and compression
- TypeScript compilation and type checking

## Security Configuration
- Proper CORS handling for API endpoints
- Environment variable validation
- Secure headers configuration
- API key protection and rotation

## Monitoring and Logging
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and reporting
- API usage monitoring
- User analytics and insights

## Development Workflow
1. Local development with hot reloading
2. TypeScript type checking
3. ESLint code quality checks
4. Build verification before deployment
5. Environment-specific testing

## Production Considerations
- CDN configuration for static assets
- Database connection pooling
- API rate limiting and caching
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Build verification and deployment
- Environment-specific configurations
- Rollback procedures for failed deployments
