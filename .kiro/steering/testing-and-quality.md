# Testing and Quality Standards

## Code Quality
- Follow ESLint configuration (ignore warnings about deprecated packages)
- Use TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries for React components
- Include comprehensive error handling in all async operations

## Testing Approach
- Write unit tests for utility functions and services
- Test React components with proper mocking
- Include integration tests for critical user flows
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize bundle size by removing unused code (as done in cleanup)
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting where appropriate
- Implement proper loading states for better UX
- Optimize images and assets for web delivery

## Security Best Practices
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Sanitize data before storing in Firebase
- Use proper authentication checks in components
- Never expose sensitive API keys in client code
- Implement proper CORS handling for API calls

## Accessibility Standards
- Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the app
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios for dark/light modes
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
- Test with screen readers

## Code Organization
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper file naming conventions
- Organize imports in logical order (external, internal, relative)
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible

## Documentation
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document API interfaces and service methods
- Maintain README files for setup and deployment
- Document environment variables and configuration

## Deployment Quality
- Ensure build process completes without errors
- Test in both development and production environments
- Verify all environment variables are properly configured
- Test Docker builds and deployments
- Monitor application performance and errors
