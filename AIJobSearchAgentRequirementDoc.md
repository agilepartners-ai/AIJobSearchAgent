We want to develop an SaaS application that can take various versions of resumes of a candidate and then look at the job description and then prepare a customize cover letter and resume based on the information from various versions of the resumes that is applicable to the job description. Iterate through customize compelling resume and cover letter such that it has more than 75% of keywords used in the Job description so it passes Application Tracking System (ATS) filter. Then format the finally generated resume and cover letter in a pleasing and formal business language and format. The application frontend is written in JavaScript and backend is written in Java. Look at following ATS and cover letter resume building apps for for reference and requirements gathering is (a) aiapply.co (b) Jobscan - <https://www.jobscan.co/> Another application for ATS and resume building app (c) <https://www.careered.ai/> (d) <https://www.grammarly.com/ai/ai-writing-tools/cover-letter-generator> (e) <https://humanizeaitext.ai/tools/cover-letter-generator>. I am attaching screen shots of aiapply.co and Jobscan. First create detail requirements documents using data. Then design document and then generate the code. Iterate over the code to improve it.

I'll help you develop a SaaS application for customizing resumes and cover letters based on job descriptions. Let me first gather information about existing solutions to understand current industry standards and features.

Based on my research of various ATS-focused resume and cover letter tools, I've gathered comprehensive information about existing products in this space. Now, I'll create a detailed requirements document for our SaaS application.

**Project Overview**  
This SaaS application aims to generate customized resumes and cover letters by analyzing multiple versions of a candidate's resume and a target job description. The system will intelligently extract relevant content, align it with the job description using natural language processing (NLP), optimize for ATS (Application Tracking System) filters, and output professionally formatted documents.

**Objective**

- Extract relevant data from multiple versions of a candidate's resume.
- Analyze a job description to determine key skills, keywords, and job requirements.
- Generate a tailored resume and cover letter that matches the job description.
- Ensure more than 75% keyword alignment to increase ATS pass rates.
- Format the final documents in a business-professional style.
- Keep record of jobs applied, thus keeping record of what you are in queue for

**Assumptions**

- Resume can only be in English

**_References for Requirements Gathering_**

- aiapply.co
- Jobscan (<https://www.jobscan.co/>)
- Careered.ai (<https://www.careered.ai/>)
- Grammarly AI Tools (<https://www.grammarly.com/ai/ai-writing-tools/cover-letter-generator>)
- Humanize AI Text (<https://humanizeaitext.ai/tools/cover-letter-generator>)

**Functional Requirements**

**1 Resume Input and Analysis**

- Upload multiple resume versions and the resume can be in any format(PDF, DOCX, TXT supported).
- Extract structured data (skills, experiences, education, achievements).
- Compare and merge relevant content across versions.
- If an upload fails, error message and log it, if wrong file type than mentioned reject the file

**Secure by Design Recommendations:**

- **Input Validation:** Strictly validate file types, sizes, and scan for malware before processing.
- **PII Masking/Redaction:** Mask or redact sensitive information during processing and storage.
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt resumes at rest and in transit.
- **Audit Logging:** Log all access and changes to resume data for traceability.

**2 Job Description Analysis**

- Upload or paste job description. Can be multiple job descriptions and for each job repeat the step1
- Parse job description to extract required skills, qualifications, and responsibilities.
- Highlight key ATS-relevant keywords.

**Secure by Design Recommendations:**

- **Sanitize Inputs:** Use input sanitization to prevent XSS or code injection.
- **Access Controls:** Restrict who can view or download parsed job descriptions.
- **Data Minimization:** Only extract and store necessary information.

**3 Custom Resume Generation**

- Match resume content to job description.
- User to be able to control sections want to control and manual edits allowed
- Optimize content to align with 75%+ of job description keywords.
- Highlight experiences and skills relevant to the role.
- Auto-generate bullet points and descriptions where gaps exist.

**Secure by Design Recommendations:**

- **User Review:** Require user approval before finalizing generated content.
- **Explainability:** Clearly show which parts were auto-generated and why.
- **Content Validation:** Use AI/ML models with guardrails to avoid inappropriate or false content.

**4 Custom Cover Letter Generation**

- Generate a tailored cover letter based on job description and resume highlights.
- User can edit the cover letter
- Include relevant achievements and motivations for applying.
- Maintain a consistent tone and voice aligned with professional standards.

**Secure by Design Recommendations:**

- **Template Controls:** Limit templates to vetted, professional formats.
- **User Confirmation:** Let users review and edit generated cover letters before export.
- **Content Filtering:** Scan generated text for PII or inappropriate language.

**5 Formatting and Export**

- Professional template selection for resumes and cover letters.
- Real-time preview.
- Export in PDF and DOCX.
- Old reports available and produced based on selection of dates or all

**Secure by Design Recommendations:**

- **Watermarking:** Optionally watermark documents to indicate draft/final status.
- **Export Controls:** Allow users to select what data is included in exports.
- **Secure Download Links:** Generate time-limited, authenticated download links.

**6 User Interface Requirements**

- Frontend in JavaScript (React preferred for modular design).
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Dashboard to manage uploaded resumes, saved jobs, generated documents.

**Secure by Design Recommendations:**

- **Secure Authentication:** Use secure tokens (e.g., JWT), implement session timeouts.
- **CSRF/XSS Protection:** Use frameworksâ€™ built-in protections and Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **Role-Based Access:** Only show data the user is authorized to see.

**7 Backend Requirements**

- Backend in Java.
- RESTful API endpoints for resume/job parsing, content generation, formatting.
- Integration with NLP/AI models for keyword extraction and generation.
- User authentication and document storage.

**Secure by Design Recommendations:**

- **API Security:** Use authentication (OAuth2/JWT), rate limiting, and input validation.
- **Model Safeguards:** Sanitize inputs to AI models; monitor for abuse.
- **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong passwords, MFA, and account lockout policies.
- **Encrypted Storage:** Store documents in encrypted form; use secure cloud storage solutions.
- **Audit Trails:** Log all API access and document changes.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

- System should generate documents within 30 seconds.
- High availability and scalability to support multiple users concurrently.
- GDPR-compliant data storage and processing.
- User-friendly onboarding and help features.

**User Roles**

- **Candidate**: Upload resumes, input job descriptions, generate documents.
- **Admin**: Manage users, monitor system health, approve template updates.

**Integration Points**

- ATS benchmarking tools for keyword comparison.
- Document parsing libraries (Apache Tika, Docx4j).
- NLP libraries or APIs (OpenAI, spaCy, BERT).

**Reporting & Analytics**

- ATS keyword match score for each document.
- User activity tracking (resume uploads, document generations).

**Future Enhancements**

- LinkedIn job scraping.
- AI feedback on tone and grammar.
- Cover letter personalization via voice input.
